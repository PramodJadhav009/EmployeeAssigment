# EmployeeAssigment
Spring boot based solution, which could:   1. Create DB Schema, DML scripts and related persistent classes to store each record(Employee record) in a DB(you may choose in memory DB like H2, HSQL), with below columns:   EmployeeID | EmployeeName | Title | BusinessUnit | Place | SupervisorID | Competencies | Salary   2. Create a /employee/place/{place}/salary/{percentage} PUT endpoint that will update each record by increasing their salary by percentage(percentage path param) for employees that have place matching with place path param.(Use java 8 for transformation). Make sure increase percentage cannot be more than 55%.   3. Create an endpoint to return the list of employees for a given place from the DB in a page size of 5.   4. Create an endpoint to return the range of salaries for a given Competency.   5. The code must have business/technical exception handling.    6. The code must be modular/follow design principles(SOLID) and has interface/implementation classes.   7. The code must have unit tests.   8. It must have Swagger (Open API) spec.
